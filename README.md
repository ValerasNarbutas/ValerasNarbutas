# Hi there 👋

**About me**

👋 Greetings!     

👨‍💻 I'm Valeras Narbutas, a developer based in Vilnius, Lithuania.

💻 Currently, I'm contributing to Microsoft 365 Patterns and Practices, an open source initiative that provides guidance and best practices for developing solutions on the Microsoft 365 platform.

💡 I believe that creating open source code and helping the community is important because it allows us to collaborate, learn from each other, and make a positive impact on the world. By contributing to open source projects, we can make technology more accessible, secure, and useful for everyone.

🙌 I'm proud to be a part of this community and look forward to continuing to contribute to open source initiatives. Thank you for your support!

🌟 In addition to my work on open source projects, I'm also a mentor in Women in Tech, a program that supports and empowers women in technology.

👩‍🏫 As a mentor, I work with aspiring women technologists to provide guidance, advice, and support as they navigate their careers.

💪 I'm passionate about helping to create a more diverse and inclusive tech industry, and believe that mentorship is one of the most effective ways to do so.

👩‍💻 By working with women in tech, I hope to help inspire the next generation of technologists and create a more equitable and innovative tech industry for all.
